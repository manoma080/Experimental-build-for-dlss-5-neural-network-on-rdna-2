## What is this?

NVIDIA's **DLSS Neural Rendering** ("DLSS 5") is a neural network that re-renders every frame: more realistic light,
skin, materials and contrast. NVIDIA only ships it for GeForce RTX cards with Tensor Cores.

This project runs **NVIDIA's own DLSS 5 network** (from NVIDIA's `nvngx_dlssnr.dll`, which you supply) on **AMD Radeon
RX 6000 (RDNA2)** cards, which have no AI hardware at all. It is a full re-implementation of the network's inference in
**our own HIP compute kernels**, written for RDNA2, plus a DirectX bridge that plugs it into games through OptiScaler.

**No HIP SDK or ROCm install needed.** The HIP runtime the port uses (`amdhip64_6.dll`) ships with the normal AMD
Adrenalin driver. You only need a recent driver, the ZIP and NVIDIA's `nvngx_dlssnr.dll`.

> **Experimental.** It can crash, look wrong, or cost a lot of FPS. Do not use it in online games with anti-cheat.

### Why v0.5 is different

- **The real look, finally.** The network has full-resolution detail blocks (skin pores, cloth, fine contrast) and a
  half-resolution main network. Earlier versions (ours and other ports) ran the whole network at 540p/720p, i.e. the
  detail at a quarter of NVIDIA's pixels. **v0.5 runs the detail blocks at your output resolution** ("hybrid mode").
  Measured in Cyberpunk at 1440p: **~3x** the on/off difference of our old 720p default, ~78 % of all pixels changed.
- **Fast enough to play:** ~35 FPS at 1440p with the full look, ~45 FPS with `Hybrid_1440_Fast` (RX 6900 XT, no frame generation).
- **No ghosting on upscaled games:** motion vectors from the upscaler (render resolution) are now scaled correctly.
- **All kernels are our own.** No NVIDIA code or data in the package; the weights are read from your copy of NVIDIA's DLL at load time.

## How it works (technical)

```
 game frame ──► OptiScaler ──► nvngx.dll_dlssnr.dll (D3D12/D3D11 bridge) ──► nr_runtime.dll (HIP, RDNA2) ──► back to the game
 (after FSR/DLSS/XeSS)          colour, depth, motion       import / export shaders,    the DLSS 5 network,
                                vectors, NR sliders         history, nr_split warp      ~80 GPU dispatches
```

**The network** (NVIDIA's 310.9.16 "small" model, also the older 310.8 model):
full-resolution **pre block** (features + a Swin block) → U-Net encoder with **Swin window-attention** levels
(C = 32/64/128/256) → a **ViT** bottleneck (8 blocks, global attention) and C=512 conv/attention blocks → decoder → full-resolution **post block**
that produces the edit. Weights and activations are **FP8 (e4m3)**; NVIDIA runs this on FP8 Tensor Cores.

**On RDNA2 (no Tensor Cores, no FP8):**
- Every GEMM runs on `v_dot2_f32_f16` (2 MACs/lane/clock) or `v_dot4_i32_i8` (int8 paths), with exact FP8 rounding emulated
  in software (`q8`/e4m3 packing in 1-2 instructions). The network output matches the PyTorch reference implementation at
  **37-43 dB** with edit correlation **0.96-0.99**.
- **Lane = token** Swin kernels (c32, c64, pre/post): one 8x8 window per 64-thread workgroup, weights streamed through
  SGPRs from a load-time shadow, attention exchanged through 12 KB of LDS (5 workgroups per CU). The new c64 kernel is
  ~25 % faster than the previous design and byte-identical.
- **ViT / C512 GEMMs:** 8x4 register tiles, 128 threads, LDS operand prefetch, swizzled LDS layout without bank conflicts.
- **Hybrid resolution:** pre/post blocks at output size, the U-Net/ViT 1.5x smaller, bridged by a resample kernel.
- **Temporal amortisation** (`nr_split`): the network runs over 2-3 frames; every displayed frame warps the newest result
  with the game's motion vectors, rejects disoccluded areas by colour/depth gates, fills them from the surroundings and
  fades new results in. The ViT reuse switches itself off on fast camera motion.
- **D3D12 ↔ HIP** share memory and fences; the game never waits longer than the network's share of the frame.

## Performance (RX 6900 XT, new model 310.9.16)

| Preset | Network | Per displayed frame | Cyberpunk 1440p | Look |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Hybrid_1440** (default) | 28-32 ms | ~14-16 ms (`nr_split=2`) | **~35 FPS** | near-full DLSS 5 |
| **Hybrid_1440_Fast** | 28-32 ms | ~10 ms (`nr_split=3`) | **~45 FPS** | near-full; moving people shimmer more |
| **Hybrid_1080** | 17-19 ms | ~9 ms | – | near-full at 1080p |
| **Full_1440** | 48 ms | ~24 ms | ~25 FPS | NVIDIA's full layout |
| `classic/` 720p / 540p | 14 / 9 ms | 3-7 ms | – | only a fraction of the effect |

Measured on the same RX 6900 XT at 720p, same new model, same benchmark harness: **this port 10.8 ms vs 19.4 ms** for another
public vendor-neutral port of the network. With frame generation (FSR-FG / XeFG) the displayed frame rate roughly doubles.

**New in v0.5** (full list in the [release notes](../../releases/tag/v0.5)): hybrid mode at output resolution, ghosting fix for
upscaled motion vectors, clean `nr_split` (fade-in, halo fix, motion gate), crash fix when NR is re-created, faster
c64/ViT kernels, new presets `Hybrid_1440`, `Hybrid_1440_Fast`, `Hybrid_1080`, `Hybrid_4K`, `Full_1440`, `Full_1080`.

<details><summary>Older versions (v0.3 - v0.4)</summary>

**New in v0.4:**
- **NVIDIA's new DLSS 5 model** (nvngx_dlssnr.dll 310.9.16) is used automatically: about **2x lighter**, ~10 ms per network run at 960x540 on an RX 6900 XT (v0.3: 24 ms). The old 310.8 DLL still works with the old model.
- **Cyberpunk 2077, 1440p, FSR Quality, no frame generation, RX 6900 XT:** 54.7 fps on High, 85.3 fps on Low (v0.3: 43.8 fps on High; danielblnc v0.6.0 on the same card: 21.7 fps).
- **Image much closer to NVIDIA's** (+6-8 dB vs the reference; 4 network bugs fixed), NVIDIA's default look, and the **OptiScaler NR sliders now work** (intensity, style, tone, structure, skin).
- **Much less flicker** (`edit_temporal`, flicker -90 %), network split over 3 frames for even, higher fps.
- **Looks to choose from** (`presets\`): Standard, Strong, Cinematic, HighQuality_720p, HiRes_1080p, Native_1440p, Performance, Community.
- **Network resolutions up to 1080p / 1440p** for more fine detail (costs fps).
- All kernels are our own; no NVIDIA data in the package. Full list: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

**New in v0.3.1:** uses the right GPU (never the iGPU), VRAM leak fix, HDR auto-exposure, clean NR-off with an unknown
`nvngx_dlssnr.dll`, all kernels our own, a bit faster and less VRAM.

**New in v0.3:** up to 60 FPS without frame generation on an RX 6900 XT, even frame pacing, no more stutter
in fast games, HDR fix (no more white characters), clean 2 passes, safe setup with backup and uninstaller.

## Does my PC work?

You need **all** of these:

| | |
|---|---|
| ✅ Graphics card | AMD **RX 6000 series**, see the table below. RX 7000/9000, NVIDIA and Intel do **not** work. |
| ✅ Windows | Windows 10 or 11, 64-bit |
| ✅ AMD driver | A recent AMD Adrenalin driver ([download](https://www.amd.com/en/support/download/drivers.html)). **Nothing else:** no HIP SDK, no ROCm. |
| ✅ Game | A 64-bit DirectX 11 or DirectX 12 game where you can choose **DLSS, FSR or XeSS** in the graphics settings |
| ✅ NVIDIA model file | `nvngx_dlssnr.dll`. **Not included**, you have to get it yourself (see step 2) |

| Graphics card | Status | Network per frame, Hybrid_1440 (v0.5) |
|---|---|---|
| RX 6900 XT / 6950 XT | ✅ tested | ~14-16 ms (measured) |
| RX 6800 / 6800 XT | ✅ works (user reports) | ~16-21 ms (estimate) |
| RX 6700 / 6700 XT / 6750 XT | ✅ works (user reports) | ~30 ms (estimate; use Hybrid_1080) |
| RX 6600 / 6600 XT / 6650 XT | ✅ works (user reports) | ~45 ms (estimate; use Hybrid_1080 or classic) |
| RX 6500 XT / 6400 | 🧪 should work, slow | use `classic/` presets |

**Runs on the whole RX 6000 (RDNA2) family.** First user reports average **about 55 FPS** in game. More reports
are welcome in [Issues](../../issues) (attach your `dlssnr_nr.log`, it lists your GPU and timings).

Not sure which graphics card you have? Press `Ctrl + Shift + Esc`, click **Performance**, click **GPU**.
The name is in the top right corner.

## Installation

### Step 0: Back up your game folder

Copy your whole game folder somewhere safe (for example to your desktop). If something goes wrong, copy it back.

### Step 1: Download

Go to [**Releases**](../../releases/latest) and download the ZIP (`DLSS5-RDNA2-Experimental-...zip`). Every RX 6000 card uses the same (latest) ZIP.

### Step 2: Get the NVIDIA model file

This mod does **not** contain any NVIDIA files. You need the file **`nvngx_dlssnr.dll`** (about 160 MB).
How to get it is explained in janblade's guide:
[Choose the correct runtime](https://github.com/janblade/OptiScaler-DLSSNR-PreSR-Multipass/blob/main/INSTALL-DLSSNR.md#choose-the-correct-runtime).

### Step 3: Find your game folder

This is the folder with the game's **real 64-bit** `.exe` file, the one that actually starts the game.
It is **not** always the main install folder: many games have a small launcher `.exe` at the top and the
real game `.exe` further down.

- **Steam:** right-click the game → **Manage** → **Browse local files**
- **Epic / GOG / others:** right-click the game → open install folder

Look for these subfolders first. If one of them has the game `.exe` inside, use **that** folder:

| Folder pattern | Example |
|---|---|
| main folder (no launcher) | `...\Fallout 4\` (has `Fallout4.exe`) |
| `bin\` or `bin\x64\` | `...\Cyberpunk 2077\bin\x64\` (has `Cyberpunk2077.exe`) |
| `x64\` | `...\GameName\x64\` |
| `<Name>\Binaries\Win64\` (Unreal games) | `...\Jedi Survivor\SwGame\Binaries\Win64\` |

Tip: start the game, open Task Manager → **Details**, right-click the game process → **Open file location**.
That opens exactly the right folder. `setup_windows.bat` warns you if the folder has no 64-bit `.exe`.

### Step 4: Copy the files

1. Open the ZIP from step 1.
2. Copy **everything** in it into the game folder. Click **Replace** if Windows asks.
3. Copy `nvngx_dlssnr.dll` from step 2 into the same game folder.

### Step 5: Run the setup

In the game folder, double-click **`setup_windows.bat`**. A black window opens and asks some questions:

> ⚠️ **Do you use ReShade or ENB?** Then **never** overwrite. If the script asks "overwrite?", answer `2` and pick `2` (`winmm.dll`). Overwriting deletes the ReShade/ENB file and the game may stop starting.

| Question | Type |
|---|---|
| "Do you want to delete these files?" (only if an old OptiScaler is there) | `1` + Enter |
| "Choose a filename for OptiScaler" | just Enter (= `dxgi.dll`) |
| "dxgi.dll already exists ... overwrite?" (you use ReShade or another mod) | `2` + Enter, then pick `2` (`winmm.dll`) |
| "Are you using an Nvidia GPU or AMD/Intel GPU?" | `1` + Enter (AMD) |

When the window says it is done, close it.

### Step 6: Start the game

1. In the game's graphics settings, turn on **DLSS**, **FSR** or **XeSS** (whatever the game offers).
2. In the game, press the **`Insert`** key. The OptiScaler menu opens.
3. Open **DLSS Neural Rendering** and make sure **Enable Neural Rendering** is ticked.
4. Press `Insert` again to close the menu.

![OptiScaler menu](images/menu.jpg)

The first start takes a few seconds longer. That is normal.

**DirectX 11 games** (for example Fallout 4): in the menu at the top, under **Upscalers**, pick an
upscaler that says **w/Dx12** (for example `FSR 2.2.1 w/Dx12`) and restart the game.

## Choosing a look

The folder `presets` has complete settings files. To switch, copy one over `nr_port.ini` in the game folder and restart the game.
The package `nr_port.ini` is **Hybrid_1440** with `model_res=auto` (it follows your output size).

| Preset | Look | Network time per frame, RX 6900 XT | When to use it |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Hybrid_1440** (default) | Near-full DLSS 5 look: detail at 1440p, main network 1.5x smaller, split over 2 frames | ~15 ms (network 29.7 ms) | 1440p screens. Cyberpunk: ~35 FPS |
| **Hybrid_1440_Fast** | Same, split over 3 frames | ~10 ms | More FPS (~45 FPS in Cyberpunk), people in motion can shimmer more |
| **Hybrid_1080** | Hybrid at 1080p | ~9 ms (network 18.2 ms) | 1080p screens, or more FPS |
| **Hybrid_4K** | Hybrid at 2160p, split over 3 | heavy | 4K screens |
| **Full_1440** / **Full_1080** | Whole network at full size (NVIDIA's layout): most detail | ~24 / ~13 ms (network 48 / 26 ms) | Screenshots, best image |
| `classic/*` | The old 360p-720p presets | 3-8 ms | Weak GPUs; **only a fraction of the effect** |

All presets use the new model (nvngx_dlssnr.dll 310.9.16). With the old 310.8 DLL the classic plans in `nr_data_h15` are used (no hybrid).
Combine with **FSR 4.1** (official on RX 6000 since driver 26.10.1) at Quality or Balanced: the network works on the upscaled picture, so a better upscaler means a better DLSS 5 result.

The OptiScaler NR sliders (intensity, style, local tone, local structure, skin) now change the image live. A key in `nr_port.ini` (e.g. `local_tone=0.5`) overrides the slider.

## Which nvngx_dlssnr.dll?

Works with nvngx_dlssnr.dll 310.8 (old model) and 310.9.16 (new, ~2x lighter model, auto-selected; model=large forces the old one). With any other model, NR switches itself off — wait for a port update.

The game keeps running with its normal image. `dlssnr_nr.log` then says "has a different model than this port supports (310.8 / 310.9.16)".

## Best image: NR + FSR 4.1 on RX 6000

The network works on the upscaled picture, so a better upscaler means a better DLSS 5 result. Since AMD driver
**26.10.1** FSR 4.1 is official on RX 6000. In OptiScaler (`OptiScaler.ini`) set `UpscalerIndex = 0` (FSR 4) and
`Fsr4Preset = 1` (Quality), then pick FSR Quality or Balanced in the game.

## Known issues (v0.5)

- Minimal white noise and slight ghosting on very fast motion remain with `nr_split`. For the cleanest picture use `nr_split=0` (slowest).
- Strong settings (intensity 2, tone 2, Cinematic) make the effect much stronger but also increase flicker; that is NVIDIA's network itself.
- With `Hybrid_1440_Fast` (`nr_split=3`) moving people can shimmer more.
- Games without motion vectors (no upscaler selected) trail with `nr_split`; select FSR, DLSS or XeSS in the game.

## It does not work. What now?

Open the file **`dlssnr_nr.log`** in the game folder with Notepad and look at the last lines:

| What the log says | What to do |
|---|---|
| `runtime ready` | It works. Check that Neural Rendering is enabled in the `Insert` menu. |
| `nvngx_dlssnr.dll missing or wrong version` | `nvngx_dlssnr.dll` is missing in the game folder, or it is a version with different weights. Get it again (step 2). |
| `not an RDNA2 GPU` | Your graphics card is not supported (see "Does my PC work?"). |
| `hipModuleLoad ...` | Your card could not load the program. Please report it in [Issues](../../issues) with the log. |
| Game says a DirectX / d3d11 / dxgi file is missing | In Steam: right-click the game → Properties → Installed Files → **Verify integrity of game files**. If you use ReShade or ENB, reinstall it. |
| No `dlssnr_nr.log` file at all | The mod did not load. Run `setup_windows.bat` again and check that you selected an upscaler in the game. |

## Uninstall

In the game folder, double-click **`Uninstall_DLSS5.bat`** and press `1`. It removes OptiScaler and our files
(`nr_data`, `nr_runtime.dll`, `nr_port.ini`, `nvngx.dll_dlssnr.dll`, logs) and puts back every file that
`setup_windows.bat` replaced or deleted (those are saved in `DLSS5_backup\`). Your `nvngx_dlssnr.dll` is kept.

## Is this faster or slower?

Slower: the network costs GPU time because RX 6000 cards have no AI units. With v0.5 (Hybrid_1440, split over 2 frames) an RX 6900 XT reaches about **35 FPS in Cyberpunk 2077 at 1440p with FSR Quality, with the full DLSS 5 look**. More FPS: `Hybrid_1440_Fast` or `Hybrid_1080`.
